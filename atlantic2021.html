									<h1>2021 Atlantic Hurricane Season</h1>
									<p>Colorado State University researchers anticipate that this hurricane season will be "above average". The main reasons to expect an above-average season include the transition from weak La Niña conditions to neutral ENSO conditions this summer/fall.The lack of El Niño conditions implies that the magnitude of the vertical wind shear will decrease. Strong vertical wind shear is associated with unfavorable conditions for the development and intensification of tropical cyclones, and the presence of El Niño conditions reduces tropical activity. Besides, sea surface temperatures across the Atlantic are nearly average, while the sea surface temperatures are warmer than normal in the subtropical Atlantic.</p>

								<p> The hurricane seasonal forecast predicts 17 named storms, of which 8 will become hurricanes and 4 major hurricanes. The probability of at least one major hurricane making landfall somewhere in the entire U.S coastline is 69%. In addition, the probability for at least one major hurricane traking in the Caribbean is 58%. This forecast is the first one of the hurricane season, and changes as approaching the peak of the season are expected. However, it only takes one tropical cyclone making landfall to change the life of thousands.  </p>
